## Welcome to Our Analysis!

In this project, we delve into the intricate relationship between crime trends and socioeconomic factors in Philadelphia. Utilizing advanced analytical techniques, we aim to uncover patterns and insights that can help in understanding and potentially mitigating crime in urban areas.

Our analysis is powered by [Quarto](https://quarto.org), enabling us to integrate Python code seamlessly with our narrative, and our findings are shared online via [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com). This platform allows us to present a comprehensive and interactive exploration of crime data and socioeconomic variables.
